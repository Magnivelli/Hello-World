# Hello-World
my introduction to Github 
and a testimony for i am a geek 
and i know next to nothing about coding or programming 
well that said i hope all is cool 
for everybody i shall encounter here .
I naturally never done anything like this 
so it can never be anything important , that i do .
And it all being chaotic , 
i definitively lack oversight .
It must be awkward .
